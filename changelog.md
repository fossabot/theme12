note:
-blog default front page is a typical index page now [and has been for a while]
  (unlike in Theme 11), but:
	-if a page named "full archives" [slug 'full-archives'] is created it
	  becomes a page that lists all the posts in the blog; and it can be set as
	  front page: thus making Theme 12 act like Theme 11

  template to serve such pages but intentionally does not link to them from the
  index page or single posts
